# Short Response
### 1
crate a branch and checkout into that branch, because if you both work in the main branch you could make lots of mistakes.

### 2
To work without affecting the main branch.

### 3
Git is a distributed version control system, and GitHub is a cloud based service that allows developers to store, track, change and control changes to their code.

They both work together, Git is where you write the code, and then GitHub stores it.

### 4
The only thing is wrong with this code is the order, it should be:

```
 git add . 
 git commit -m "saving work"
 git push
 ```

 Everything else in this code is right.
